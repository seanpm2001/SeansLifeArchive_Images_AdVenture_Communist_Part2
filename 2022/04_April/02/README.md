I made some progress in rank 57 and I will most likely be able to rank up next week. The game did not have any updates today.

Today, I considered not playing to show support for Ukraine, but decided that it was appropriate, as this game isn't pro-communism, it is mostly political satire if it even alludes to this. I still hope for Ukraine to become at peace again, for the fighting to stop, and for Ukraine to rebuild. - 2022 March 5th

<!-- 2022.03.12 Notes
AdCom session notes 2022 March 12th

Upgraded various cards in both the motherland and the event
Another very long, excessive session
Ad instability
!-->

I had a slightly longer, excessive session again today. I quit after eventually forcing myself to stop due to low battery (7%). I stayed in rank 57, and made minor progress in the new rank. I unlocked Nate Polly, and can now automate my crop dusters. I also spent a lot of time in the event today, but forced myself to quit after I ran out of things to do, and because I was playing for too long. The game did not have any updates today.

I updated various cards today. The game has unstable ads, and after some research, I found the developers have refused to fix this for the games entire lifespan. - 2022 March 11th

I had a very long session today, and made some progress. I eventually quit after my battery reached 5%. I ranked up to rank 58, and made some progress in the new rank. From my rewards from last weeks event, I unlocked a new researcher that gives a resource boost, and also got another supreme card, which let me double my comrade/second. I worked extensively on trying to unlock as much as I could and gain as many c/s before I quit. The game had unstable ads today, and after the game crashed the moment I clicked on an ad boost, I decided not to use anymore for a while. - 2022 March 19th

I had a long session today, and made some progress. I eventually quit after my battery reached 3%. I stayed in rank 58, and made little progress. I upgraded 1 card today. I did an update today, but the game still had unstable ads again today, and I repeatedly avoided most air drops. There has been a recent controversy with this game, and the threat of it dying out, most of the criticism is the failure to addres issues with ads. I will continue to play this game weekly until further notice. - 2022 March 25th

I had a long session today, and made some progress. I eventually quit after my battery reached 8%. I stayed in rank 58, and made little progress. I upgraded 2 cardS today. I focused on getting some industries to the point where I couldn't do effective upgrades anymore today. There has been a recent controversy with this game, and the threat of it dying out, most of the criticism is the failure to addres issues with ads. I will continue to play this game weekly until further notice. - 2022 April 2nd

There was a new event available this week that was quite addicting. It is based off Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It also has a really good soundtrack.

I continued to play the Glorious Potato Factory event again this week, unfortunately, I won't be making it past rank 9. Eventually, I ran out of things to do, and ran out of time.

## HyperHippo issues

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 April 2nd/9th
