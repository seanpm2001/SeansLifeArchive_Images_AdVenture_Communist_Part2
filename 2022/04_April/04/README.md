# 2022 April 4th - Didn't play

I didn't play AdVenture Communist today. I took a break from it, as I didn't have the time. I wanted to play today, but I didn't have the time.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Saturday. I will be playing again on Saturday, 2022 April 2nd.

## HyperHippo issues

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 April 2nd/9th
